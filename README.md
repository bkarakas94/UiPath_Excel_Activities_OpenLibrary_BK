In this project you can find the source code for a UiPath Excel library which you can customize and use in your organization. This project supports Windows compatibility. I will also create another project where you can find the source code for Legacy compatibility. Unfortunately I dont have access to a Legacy environment since I am developing these libraries in a community edition. This version of my library is compatible with UiPath excel scopes. I recommend official UiPath excel activities where applicable. Please see the example workflows and screenshots I provided. This library is intended for free use of every UiPath customer. Licensing/distribution of this library is not allowed. Please reach out to me for issues or feature requests at in/bariskarakas/ I will add more features in the upcoming days. For the use of these libraries please see the component workflows under _EXAMPLE_COMPONENTS folder Best Baris
